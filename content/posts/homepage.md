### Hi There! Welcome to the blog for OSINTer
So you ended up on the homepage for the OSINTer project! Maybe someone sent you a link to this page, maybe you came looking for it yourself or maybe you just simply stumbled upon this by accident, but whatever brought you here, if you're curious about what in the world this is, keep reading and I will do my best to explain it.

OSINTer is - in a nutshell - a digital platform that has been developed for the last one and a half year with the ultimate goal of strengthening cybersecurity. You can read much more about what specifically this means on the [*About The Project*]({{ url_for('post', name='aboutTheProject') }}) page and about the people behind this on the [*About Us*]({{ url_for('post', name='aboutUs') }}) page, but these pages can be quite lengthy and filled with technical jargon - which is probably not what you're here for - so for now I'm going to keep it relatively short.

As mentioned, OSINTer is a digital platform that aims to help experts secure our digital infrastructure against potential threats in cyberspace. Specifically, OSINTer targets specalists within the Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) field, which are people who essentially do trend analysis within cyberspace, to help other experts prevent cyberattacks before they even happen and helps them, by supplying them with the information needed to do this trend analysis. It accomplishes this by looking into the constant stream of news and information we get bombarded with online, picks out the pieces of information that would be relevant to a CTI specalist, cleans it up and lastly organizes it in a way that allows handling the vast amounts of data and access to historical data.

In other words, OSINTer is - at it's core - "just" an advanced news-aggregator and -feed, for the people who are helping us avoid potential catastrophic cyberattacks, but as far as I'm aware, it's also the first source-available platform ever to attempt this level of data archival, and as such it's a rather uniqeu project. Previously, it was being developed under a FOSS license, but due to complications regarding funding, it's currently unlicensed (all rights reserved), so if you would want to contribute (or just have some questions), please reach out [on email](mailto:skrivtilbertram@gmail.com), and we will figure something out. I would love to hear from you.
